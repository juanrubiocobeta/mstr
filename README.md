## About This Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as a **central storage** for my progress during the **Master's Degree in Applied Statistics** at the **University of Granada (UGR)**.

Here you will find code snippets, practical exercises, notes, and small projects developed throughout the program.

## Motivation

I decided to pursue this Master's degree to bridge the gap between theoretical statistics and modern data science. My main goals are:

* **Deepen my understanding** of statistical methods.
* **Enhance my computational skills**, focusing on the practical utility of statistics in real-world problems.
* **Apply rigorous analysis** to complex datasets.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this is a **"monorepo" for academic storage**. 

* It is **not** a single deployed application or a polished final product.
* The structure follows the subjects and modules of the Master's program.
* Some scripts might be experimental or part of ongoing coursework.

*This repository tracks my journey in advanced statistical learning.*
